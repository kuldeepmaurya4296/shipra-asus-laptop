# App Login Credentials (Development)

Since the app is in **Mock Authentication Mode**, you do not need real credentials.

## 1. App Login
You can use **any** details to log in:
- **Phone Number**: `9999999999` (or any 10-digit number)
- **OTP Code**: `123456` (Universal Code) or whatever code is printed in the backend terminal.

## 2. "Expo Go" Login
If you see a screen asking for an Expo account: **IGNORE IT.**
You do not need to log in to Expo to run your local project.
Just press **`a`** in your terminal to reload the Android app.

## 3. How to Run
1.  **Backend**: `node backend/server.js` (Must be running!)
2.  **App**: `npx expo start` -> Press `a`
